# Rate Limiting

A rate limit is enforced on the API to prevent abuse and discourage the sharing of API keys. Each account tier is allowed one active API key at any given time and each key may make x queries per second.

???+ info

    In the event an API key is exposed, you may generate a new one from your account page. The old key will become invalid.
